## Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to help you think, critically and visually, about the connections between the various principles, institutions, and actors of American politics. You will need to identify the concepts you think are key to understanding American politics.


## Task

Build a concept map for each of the three major parts of the course (i.e, the foundations of American governments, the institutions, and the public). You can either draw this concept map or you can use a platform like [Miro](https://miro.com/aq/ps/concept-map-1/) to do it. Your concept map can include concepts, events, political figures, other political actors, examples, or anything else that you think is important.

Your concept map should be submitted as a PDF on Canvas.


## Criteria for success

A successful concept map (each submission) will:

1. Include at least 20 unique nodes (these are the boxes or circles that represent a concept, object, or idea)
2. Have a coherent hierarchical structure
3. Have no grammatical errors
